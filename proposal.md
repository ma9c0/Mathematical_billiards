## Proposal 1: Attraction point/ Energy

-- Abstract: 
    Given an ellipse and an attraction point with certain level of attraction that affect the movement of the ball with a ratio between the distance of the ball to the attraction point and the amount of affection, observe the movements and variations with different level of attractions, positions of the attraction point, and the shape of the ellipse by analysis the phase space, especially with regards to the regularity or chaos.

    Classical billiards in magnetic fields by M Robnik and M V Berry, 1984:
        - |Tr M| = 2|1-2l(K_1 + K_2) + 2l^2 K_1 K_2|
        - |Tr M| < 2: stability ; > 2: instability
        - l = l(s_1, s_2), K_1 = K(s_1)
        - In the strong-field limit KR -> 0: p = p_0 + (R(L(s_0)) - K(s))/3*(1-p_0^2)
        - In the weak-field limit KR -> infinite, p = -> +- 1: R^(-1)C(s,p)->K(s)/(1-p^2)^(3/2)
